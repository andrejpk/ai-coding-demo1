## API Design Document for Next.js Project (2/21/2025, 2:39:50 PM)

_**User**_

I am building the api for my project.

Background: @project-vision.md 

The UI services are in @services . Please look at thoes files for what we need to implement.
You are an experienced software engineer and architect advising on this project.

I want ot use the Prisma ORM and a MySQL database. For now we will store the database file locally.

I want a service layer but don't need a REST API yet. Use server-side rending and next.js data access patterns.

Do not write code! Write a design document in @/docs for this work.

- Detailed design for approach including any tools needed and overal structure

ask me any questions you need. 

No coding, just create the design doc for the experenced software engineer to use to implement.

+ # API Service Layer Design Document
+ 
+ ## 1. Introduction
+ 
+ This document outlines the design for the API service layer for the Kubernetes Automation Agent UI. The API will leverage Next.js server-side rendering and data access patterns, and will use Prisma as the ORM for interfacing with a MySQL database. The current UI services (located in `/lib/services`) serve as the basis for the anticipated service layer architecture.
+ 
+ ## 2. Architecture Overview
+ 
+ - **Framework & Patterns:**
+ 
+   - Next.js with server-side rendering (SSR) and data fetching using either `getServerSideProps` (for pages) or server components (in the App Router).
+   - Service layer functions will be imported directly into server-side contexts, avoiding the need for a separate REST API initially.
+ 
+ - **ORM & Database:**
+   - **Prisma ORM** will be used for type-safe database operations and schema management.
+   - **MySQL Database** (running locally for now) will serve as the primary data store. Future enhancements might include containerization (e.g., via Docker) for easier management.
+ 
+ ## 3. Service Layer Design
+ 
+ - **Structure:**
+ 
+   - The existing services (e.g., `mockServices.ts` and `types.ts` in `/lib/services`) will be refactored or extended to include actual database interactions using Prisma.
+   - A domain-specific service structure is recommended (e.g., separate files for handling users, clusters, manifests, etc.).
+ 
+ - **Responsibilities:**
+ 
+   - Define business logic and CRUD operations around domain entities.
+   - Encapsulate database access details within service functions.
+   - Provide a clear contract (via TypeScript interfaces) for the rest of the application to interact with data.
+ 
+ - **Error Handling:**
+   - Include robust error handling and logging within the service layer to accommodate both development and production needs.
+ 
+ ## 4. Database and ORM Setup
+ 
+ - **Prisma Schema:**
+ 
+   - Define the initial schema in `prisma/schema.prisma` with models representing the necessary domain entities (e.g., Users, Clusters, Manifests).
+   - Use Prisma Migrate for iterative schema changes and database migrations.
+ 
+ - **Local MySQL Configuration:**
+   - For development, configure the Prisma connection string to point to a locally running MySQL server (or a Dockerized instance if preferred).
+   - Ensure that the local setup is easy to replicate for all developers.
+ 
+ ## 5. Next.js Data Access Patterns
+ 
+ - **Server-Side Data Fetching:**
+ 
+   - Utilize Next.js server-side rendering techniques such as `getServerSideProps` (or server components in the App Router) to fetch data via the service layer.
+   - Import service layer functions directly into Next.js pages to retrieve data at request time.
+ 
+ - **Type Safety:**
+ 
+   - Leverage TypeScript throughout the API layer, ensuring consistency between Prisma models and service layer interfaces.
+ 
+ - **Future Considerations:**
+   - Although a REST API is not required at this stage, the service layer should be designed to allow easy extension into REST or GraphQL endpoints if needed later.
+ 
+ ## 6. Tools and Dependencies
+ 
+ - **Prisma ORM:** Ensures type-safe interactions with the database and efficient schema migrations.
+ - **MySQL Database:** Acts as the persistence layer; for development, a local instance is sufficient.
+ - **Next.js & TypeScript:** Provide the framework for server-side rendering and robust typing.
+ - **ESLint & Tailwind CSS:** Already configured to maintain code quality and consistent styling.
+ - **Optional:** Docker (or Docker Compose) for managing a local MySQL instance if desired.
+ 
+ ## 7. Implementation Steps
+ 
+ 1. **Schema Definition:**
+ 
+    - Define and iterate on the Prisma schema in `prisma/schema.prisma` based on confirmed domain entities.
+    - Run `npx prisma generate` and `npx prisma migrate dev` to set up the database.
+ 
+ 2. **Service Layer Development:**
+ 
+    - Refactor the existing mock services in `/lib/services` to implement actual data fetching and manipulation using Prisma Client.
+    - Organize service modules by domain (e.g., UserService, ClusterService, ManifestService).
+ 
+ 3. **Integration with Next.js:**
+ 
+    - Update Next.js pages/components to utilize the new service functions within server-rendered contexts.
+    - Ensure that all data fetching operations are fully typed and handle errors gracefully.
+ 
+ 4. **Testing & Validation:**
+ 
+    - Write unit tests for the service layer functions.
+    - Implement integration tests to verify end-to-end data access and manipulation.
+ 
+ 5. **Documentation & Review:**
+    - Document the API service design and usage guidelines for the development team.
+    - Address any open questions and iterate on the design as necessary.
+ 
+ ## 8. Open Questions / Discussion Points
+ 
+ - **Domain Models:**
+ 
+   - What are the key domain entities that need to be supported in the initial implementation (e.g., users, clusters, manifests)?
+   - Are there any complex relationships or operations (such as transactions or batch updates) that we should plan for now?
+ 
+ - **Deployment Setup:**
+ 
+   - How should the local MySQL database be managed? Should we use Docker for local development or rely on a native installation?
+ 
+ - **Error Handling & Logging:**
+ 
+   - What are the expectations for error reporting and logging? Should errors be surfaced directly on the UI or logged silently for backend analysis?
+ 
+ - **Future API Extensions:**
+   - Although a REST API is not required at this time, should the design anticipate transitional patterns towards exposing external endpoints in the future?
+ 
+ ## 9. Conclusion
+ 
+ This design document outlines a scalable and maintainable approach to building the API service layer for our Next.js application using Prisma ORM and a locally hosted MySQL database. By adhering to server-side rendering patterns and leveraging Next.js data fetching paradigms, the project will be well-positioned to expand and evolve.
+ 
+ Please review and provide any additional requirements or clarifications necessary to refine this design further.

_****_

I've created a design document (located at docs/api-design.md) that outlines the overall approach and structure for the API service layer. It covers the architecture overview, service layer design, database and ORM setup, Next.js data access patterns, tools and dependencies, as well as detailed implementation steps. In addition, I've included a section with open questions to clarify several points.

Before we move forward, could you help me clarify a few points?

1. Domain Models: Which key domain entities do you envision initially? (For example, in addition to clusters and manifests, do you need to support users, policies, or any other entities?)
2. Deployment & Environment: Would you prefer to manage the local MySQL instance via Docker (or Docker Compose), or will each developer run a native installation? Any specifics on configuration or credential handling?
3. Error Handling & Logging: What are the expectations regarding logging (e.g., should errors get surfaced to the UI, or will we log them for backend review)? Do you have any requirements for monitoring or alerting?
4. Future API Extensions: While a REST API is not needed now, should we plan for a structure that can be easily extended to expose external endpoints (or even a GraphQL API) as the project evolves?
5. Integration Aspects: Are there any particular patterns or technologies, external to Prisma and Next.js SSR, that youâ€™d like this design to account for, especially in relation to our existing UI service layer?

Once I have your feedback on these points, we can refine the document further. Let me know if you need any additional details or have other questions!
