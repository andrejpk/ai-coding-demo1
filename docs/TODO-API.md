# API Service Layer Implementation Plan

Based on the design outlined in [api-design.md](./api-design.md), below is a detailed checklist for implementing the API service layer feature. Each task must be completed and validated before moving on to the next.

## Task Checklist

### [x] 1. Define & Update Prisma Schema

- **Description:**
  - Define the domain entities in `prisma/schema.prisma` for the API service layer (e.g., Users, Clusters, Manifests).
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] Identify and outline required domain models.
  - [x] Update `prisma/schema.prisma` with the new models and relationships.
  - [x] Run `npx prisma generate` to update Prisma Client.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - `prisma/schema.prisma` contains models that accurately reflect the business domain.
  - No type errors are encountered when using the Prisma Client in service functions.

### [x] 2. Set Up Prisma Migrations

- **Description:**
  - Establish a migration workflow to apply schema changes to a local SQLite database.
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] Create `.data` directory for SQLite database
  - [x] Update database connection string for SQLite
  - [x] Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to create migration files
  - [x] Validate that migrations are applied without errors
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Migration files are successfully created and applied
  - The local SQLite database is created and reflects the updated schema
  - The `.data` directory is properly gitignored

### [x] 3. Refactor & Implement Service Layer

- **Description:**
  - Convert existing mock services in `/lib/services` (e.g., `mockServices.ts` and `types.ts`) into real service modules using Prisma.
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] Create domain-specific service files (e.g., `userService.ts`, `clusterService.ts`, `manifestService.ts`).
  - [x] Implement CRUD operations using Prisma Client.
  - [x] Incorporate proper error handling and logging.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Service modules are type-safe and correctly perform database interactions with Prisma.
  - Basic CRUD operations for each domain are functional and verified.

### [x] 4. Integrate Service Layer with Next.js

- **Description:**
  - Update Next.js pages/components to utilize the new API service layer for data fetching via SSR.
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] Modify server-side data fetching functions (such as `getServerSideProps` or server components) to call the new service functions.
  - [x] Ensure components render fetched data correctly.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Pages load and render data without errors using the new service layer.
  - TypeScript enforcement ensures correct prop and data types.

### [x] 5. Improve Error Handling & Logging

- **Description:**
  - Enhance error handling across service functions and integrate logging mechanisms where necessary.
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] Identify and capture potential edge cases within service functions.
  - [x] Integrate with existing logging utilities or add specific logging as needed.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Errors are handled gracefully and logged appropriately.
  - The UI and API responses display user-friendly error messages when issues occur.

### [x] 6. Testing

- **Description:**
  - Write tests to ensure the proper functionality of the API service layer.
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] Develop unit tests for each service module.
  - [x] Implement integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality in Next.js pages.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - All tests pass successfully.
  - Test coverage meets the required threshold.

### [x] 7. Documentation & Review

- **Description:**
  - Update project documentation to reflect the new service layer implementation and usage guidelines.
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] Update `docs/api-design.md` with any changes or decisions made during implementation.
  - [x] Create additional documentation (e.g., API usage guides, developer setup instructions) as needed.
  - [x] Conduct a review meeting with the team to walk through changes.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Documentation is clear, complete, and accessible to the development team.
  - The team is aligned on the implementation strategy and any adjustments are documented.

---

This plan should be executed sequentially to ensure stability and accuracy at each stage of the implementation. Additional tasks or modifications may arise during development, and each should be incorporated into this plan with proper documentation.
