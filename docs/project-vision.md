# Kuberntes Automation Agent UI

This is a UI for automating kubernets devops tasks. We will be working with manifests and git repos of YAML files, and with Kubernetes clusters.

## UI Structure

THe UI should be a split navigation UI with a file or cluster explorer on the left, a middle area for working with clusters or source files, and a change window on the right to interact with the LLM/AI agent.

Look/feel: Devs like dark mode, make it sleek, efficient and modern. Fun and irreverent.
